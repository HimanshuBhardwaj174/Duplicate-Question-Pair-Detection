# Quora Question Duplication Detection

Quora is a popular question-answer platform where users can create, edit, and comment on answers and questions. One challenge Quora faces is dealing with repeated questions and answers, which is a difficult task. Natural language processing (NLP) is an effective method for determining duplicate or similar questions. Misclassifying duplicate questions can be costly. Identifying semantically identical questions on Q&A platforms like Quora is crucial for maintaining high-quality content and enhancing the overall user experience.

Detecting duplicate questions is challenging because natural language is highly expressive, and the same intent can be conveyed using different words, phrases, and sentence structures. Machine learning and deep learning methods have shown superior results over traditional NLP techniques in identifying similar texts.
